=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<catkin_lint> checks package configurations for the catkin build system of B<ROS>.
It runs a static analysis of the C<package.xml> and C<CMakeLists.txt> files in your package,
and it will detect and report a number of common problems.

All diagnosed problems come in one of three possible severities:

I<Errors> are severe enough to break the build and/or produce unintended side effects.
Usually, they violate the rules outlined in the catkin manual.

I<Warnings> are potential errors which may indicate a bug in your package but may be justified
for reasons **catkin_lint** cannot discern. Constructs which trigger a warning can usually
be modified in a way that is functionally equivalent but more robust.

I<Notices> are issues which are not objectionable from a technical view point but should be
addressed to improve the quality of the package. Many notices highlight violations of the
recommendations and best practises from the catkin manual.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--config> I<FILE>

Read configuration settings from <FILE>. This option can be used multiple times.
See L<CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT> for a more in-depth explanation.

=item B<--quiet>, B<-q>

Suppress all outputs expect for the detected problems, in particular, do not show
the summary at the end. The corresponding configuration file option is C<quiet=yes>.

=item B<--no-quiet>

Show a summary of the findings at the end. The corresponding configuration option
is C<quiet=no>.

=item B<--severity-level> I<LEVEL>, B<-W> I<LEVEL>

Choose the severity level for diagnostic output. Level 0 displays errors only,
level 1 displays errors and warnings, and level 2 displays everything.
The corresponding configuration file option is C<severity_level=I<LEVEL>>.

=item B<--notice> I<ID>, B<--warning> I<ID>, B<--error> I<ID>

Override the default severity of certain problems. See the online manual for a list
of possible message IDs.

=item B<--ignore> I<ID>

Ignore a problem. This is mostly useful to work around a known bug in B<catkin_lint>,
because problems tend to not go away if you ignore them.

=item B<--show-ignored>

Show all problems you ignored. Use this if an ignored problem did not go away, but
you forgot which one.

=item B<--strict>

Treat any reported problem as a fatal error. Some people use the option to enforce
that warnings get fixed, too. You can also combine this with B<-W2>
to turn even notices into errors, if you are exceptionally pedantic and/or have a
high pain tolerance. The corresponding configuration file option is C<strict=yes>.

=item B<--no-strict>

This will undo the effects of your rash decision to put `strict=yes` in your
configuration file.

=item B<--pkg> I<PKG>

Check the package I<PKG> for problems. The package must be in the ROS package search
path.

=item B<--skip-pkg> I<PKG>

Skip the package I<PKG> when processing a package subtree. The package will not be linted,
but it will be treated as a known package for dependency resolutions.

=item B<--package-path> I<PATH>[:I<PATH>[...]]

Add one or more additional locations to the ROS package search path. Separate multiple
locations with C<:>. B<catkin_lint> will use this path list and the B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>
environment variable to resolve the B<--pkg> option and dependencies of linted packages.

=item B<--skip-path> I<PATH>

Skip packages if their location contains I<PATH>. No wildcards or pattern matching allowed,
only proper substrings are recognized.

=item B<--rosdistro> I<DISTRO>

Assume that the package is supposed to work with the ROS distribution I<DISTRO>. Usually, this
value is queried from the B<ROS_DISTRO> environment variable. B<catkin_lint> will use this to
query the ROS database for packages which are not locally installed.

=item B<--offline>

Forbid metadata queries to the ROS package index. This will disable certain diagnostics which
rely on knowing details about all package dependencies. Metadata queries are not needed for
packages which can be found locally through the ROS package search path. The
corresponding configuration file option is C<offline=yes>.

=item B<--no-offline>

Allow metadata queries to the ROS package index. The corresponding configuration file option is
C<offline=no>.

=item B<--resolve-env>

Resolve environment variables B<$ENV{}> in CMake scripts. By default, B<catkin_lint> will ignore
environment variables and issue a warning. The corresponding configuration file option is C<resolve_env=yes>.

=item B<--no-resolve-env>

Do not resolve environment variables B<$ENV{}> in CMake scripts. The corresponding configuration
option is C<resolve_env=no>.

=item B<--output> I<FORMAT>

Select the output format for the diagnosed problems. Valid output formats are B<text>, B<explain>,
B<json>, and B<xml>. The corresponding configuration file option is C<output=I<FORMAT>>.
See L<OUTPUT FORMATS> for more details.

=item B<--text>, B<--explain>, B<--json>, B<--xml>

These are deprecated aliases for B<--output> I<FORMAT>.

=item B<--color> I<MODE>

Configure the colorization of the B<text> and B<explain> output formats. The default mode is B<auto>,
which will use ANSI colors if B<catkin_lint> detects a terminal as output. The modes B<always> and
B<never> will override the detection and output ANSI colors always or never, respectively. The
corresponding configuration file option is C<color=I<MODE>>.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FORMATS

B<catkin_lint> supports a variety of output formats as argument for the B<--output> option:

=over

=item B<text>

This is the default format, which outputs a short, human-readable description of all problems.

=item B<explain>

This is an extended B<text> format, which will show an additional explanation when a problem type
occurs for the first time. It will also mention the message ID which you need for certain
configuration options.

=item B<json>

Outputs all problems in JSON format.

=item B<xml>

Outputs all problems in XML format.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<catkin_lint> generally ignores environment variables (unless told otherwise with B<--resolve-env>). Two
notable exceptions are B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH> to find locally available packages and B<ROS_DISTRO> to 
determine the installed ROS distribution when querying the ROS package index or the B<rosdep> database.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

=over

=item B<0>

All packages were linted successfully and no errors occurred.

=item B<1>

An error occurred.

=item B<66>

No packages found.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

B<catkin_lint> will take configuration options from the following locations

=over 

=item *

Command line arguments

=item *

Files explicitly specified using B<--config>

=item *

F<.catkin_lint> files in all locations listed in B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>

=item *

F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/catkin_lint>

=item *

F<~/.config/catkin_lint> if B<XDG_CONFIG_HOME> is unset or empty

=item *

F<~/.catkin_lint>

=back

Earlier entries in this list take precedence if multiple conflicting options are
given.

Configuration files are in an INI-style format with one or more sections in it.
The main section is called C<[catkin_lint]> and will take B<catkin_lint> specific
options; see L<OPTIONS> for details.

All other sections are interpreted as package names and will override the reported
severities of problems. As a special case, the section C<[*]> will apply to all
packages. The overrides are specified in the format C<Message ID = Severity>, where
the severity can be one of B<ignore>, B<error>, B<warning>, B<notice>, or B<default>.

As an example, consider the following configuration:

    [catkin_lint]
    output = json
    quiet = yes

    [*]
    unknown_package = ignore
    unsorted_list = warning

    [foo]
    unknown_package = default

This configuration will instruct B<catkin_lint> to output its results in JSON format,
ignore any problems with unknown packages (except in the package foo), and elevate the
notice about unsorted lists to a warning for all packages (including foo).


=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item B<catkin_lint <~/catkin_ws/src>

Check all packages in F<~/catkin_ws/src> for problems.

=item B<catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar>

Check the packages C<foo> and C<bar> for problems, assuming that
they can be found in one of the locations listed in B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>.

=item B<catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar --package-path ~/my_other_ws/src>

Check the packages C<foo> and C<bar> for problems when the
former assumption turned out to be false.

=item B<catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-path unstable>

Check all packages in F<~/catkin_ws/src>, but skip all packages in a path
that contains the string C<unstable>.

=item B<catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-pkg baz>

Check all packages except C<baz> in F<~/catkin_ws/src>.
